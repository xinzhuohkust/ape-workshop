Impact of hydrogeological events on firmsâ€™ survival and performance.

## Literature Review
::: {.theme-section}
*Previous literature has yielded mixed evidence*:

- Economies may not recover to the previous trend.
- Economies may recover to the previous trend and even go faster.
  
*Gap in current studies*: 

- Only focus on regional or country-level outcomes while ignoring multiple and less severe events that may also have economic costs.

## Data and Variables Building: Hydrogeological Events
::: {.theme-section}
A complete nationwide dataset of hydrogeological events (floods and landslides) with detailed and reliable spatial and temporal accuracy.

- SECAGN (Semantic Engine to Classify And Geotag News), a semantic search engine that constantly scans the internet (at 30-min intervals) searching for news connected to landslides, floods, or similar phenomena.
